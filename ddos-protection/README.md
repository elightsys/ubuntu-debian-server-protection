# DDoS Protection

This section covers techniques to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm a serverâ€™s resources, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

## Applied Techniques

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Limit the number of requests allowed from a single IP address within a specified time period.
   - [Guide to setting up rate limiting](rate-limiting-setup.md)

2. **Reverse Proxy Configuration**
   - Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or HAProxy) to distribute incoming requests and filter malicious traffic.

3. **Firewall Rules**
   - Set up firewall rules to block known malicious IP addresses and control traffic flow.
